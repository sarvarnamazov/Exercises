    Exercise: Distance Traveled

    The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
    distance = speed * time
    For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is
    120 miles.
    Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and
    how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the
    distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example
    of the output:
    What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
    How many hours has it traveled? 3
    Hour Distance Traveled
    --------------------------------
    1       40
    2       80
    3       120
    Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any
    value less than 1 for time traveled.

function distanceTraveled(speed, time) {
    if (speed < 0 || time < 1) {
        console.log('The speed cannot be negative or time cannot be less than 1!');
    } else {
        console.log('Hour   Distance Traveled');
        console.log('________________________');
        for (let i = 1; i <= time; i++) {
            console.log(i, '    ', i * speed);
        }
    }
}
